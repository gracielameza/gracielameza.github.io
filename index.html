    <h1>Gracie Talks About Anime</h1>  
    <p>Since I can (I guess) write about <strong>anything</strong>, I'll just talk about 
    an anime I like, and it's considered as a fairly normal beginner entry for people who don't usually 
    like anime. <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name>Your Name</a> is about two teenagers who wake 
    up one day, only to discover that they have switched bodies. As they both try to figure out why this is happening,
    they learn more about each other and learn more about their connection. This is a <strong>romantic fantasy</strong> film, 
    and it's beautifully animated.</p>
